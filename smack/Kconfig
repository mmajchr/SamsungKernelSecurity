	  This selects the Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel.
	  Smack is useful for sensitivity, integrity, and a variety

config SECURITY_SMACK_BRINGUP
	bool "Reporting on access granted by Smack rules"
	depends on SECURITY_SMACK
	default n
	help
	  Enable the bring-up ("b") access mode in Smack rules.
	  When access is granted by a rule with the "b" mode a
	  message about the access requested is generated. The
	  intention is that a process can be granted a wide set
	  of access initially with the bringup mode set on the
	  rules. The developer can use the information to
	  identify which rules are necessary and what accesses
	  may be inappropriate. The developer can reduce the
	  access rule set once the behavior is well understood.
	  This is a superior mechanism to the oft abused
	  "permissive" mode of other systems.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

	  Using this option we can remove limitation of smack error log.
	  If we use this option smack log will not be lost . This option categorise
	  printk log level as given below.
	  log count less than 10 : KERN_ERR
	  log count more than 10 : KERN_INFO

config SECURITY_SMACK_BOOTMODE_FOR_DEV_NODE

	default n
	help
	  If there is permission error at device node file access time,
	  at present system crashes.In current scenario, there is possibility
	  for delay in device label setting due to performance.
	  Using this option, if there is permission error while accessing
	  device node file at boot time,process will wait 5sec for smack label
	  to get set. If smack label gets set within 5sec then process will
	  wakeup and try again make permission check for device file access.

config SECURITY_SMACK_SYSTEM_MODE
	bool "SMACK system mode setting"
	depends on SECURITY_SMACK
	default n
	help
	Using this option we can select system wide mode for SMACK module.
	If it is set to y in that case there will be SMACK permissive mode
	and rule list check for different system calls but no permission error.
	By default this is set to y.

config SECURITY_SMACK_SET_DEV_SMK_LABEL

	Using this option we can setting the smack label with same timming whitch
	the device driver create. If we use this CONFIG, It will be remove timming
	issue between create time of drvier and set time of smack label.
	And If we use this CONFIG, we can remove all of job to set smack label and
	wait untill set untill smack label by user area.

       default n
       ---help---
       If there is permission error at file access time,
       It is difficult to find in which module error occurred using
       smack log. Because some processes link to many kind of libraries.
       and if it is very complex code logic then it is very difficult to
       find correct error cause.If there is user backtrace information,
       then it is easy to define the place and reason of smack error.
